# Numab - Highlights of tech platform & competitive edge
http://www.numab.com/

Using a novel, rational process, our proprietary discovery and engineering technology yields multispecific antibody-based therapeutics with tailored pharmacokinetic properties that improve on first generation antibody therapies in terms of potency, stability, effect duration and safety. Alongside our own in-house pipeline programs we have a number of strong discovery and development partnerships with pharma and biotech.

Numab and Intarcia have a first candidate to combine a tri-specific antibody fragment with a mini-osmotic pump delivery system to fight autoimmune disease.

Numab and Intarcia partnered in 2015 to develop a new form of treatment for diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases. After initial research, the team has now selected its first candidate for clinical development, triggering a milestone payment for Numab that raises the amount received through this deal to CHF 11.5M (€10M).

The candidate is a tri-specific antibody fragment for autoimmune indications made with Numab’s MATCH technology, which has attracted several partners thanks to its ability to combine up to six binding domains in a single drug candidate.

The next step will be taken up by Intarcia, which will integrate the candidate with its signature delivery technology, the Medici Drug Delivery System. It consists of an osmotic pump, the size of a match, that is implanted under the skin and releases the drug within over time, removing the need for frequent injections in favor of a minimally invasive procedure once or twice a year. The US firm is investigating uses for the device that include type 2 diabetes and HIV prevention.

While Intarcia takes on development, Numab has also announced its intention to raise a CHF 30M (€26M) round to accelerate the development of its proprietary candidates for cancer and autoimmune disease.

# Source
The infix preceding the -mab suffix denotes the animal origin of the antibodies.[1] Although the original monoclonal antibodies were produced in mice (infix, -o-), these antibodies are recognized as foreign by human immune systems and may be rapidly cleared, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. Therefore, parts of the antibody may be replaced with human sequences. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, it is termed chimeric and the infix used is -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is termed humanized and the infix used is -zu-. Antibodies originating in humans use -u-.

# Infix for target
The infix preceding the source of the antibodies refers to medicine’s target. Most of these consist of a consonant, vowel, then another consonant. For ease of pronunciation and to avoid awkwardness, the final consonant is dropped if the following infix begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-). Examples of these include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system and -tu(m)- for miscellaneous tumors (cancers).[1]

# Prefix and second word
Finally, the prefix carries no special meaning and should be unique for each medicine. A second word may be added if there is another substance attached or linked.

# Examples
Abciximab is a commonly used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. It can be broken down into ab- + -ci(r)- + -xi- + -mab. Therefore, it is a chimeric monoclonal antibody used on the cardiovascular system.

Another example is the breast cancer medication trastuzumab, which can be broken down into tras- + -tu(m)- + -zu- + -mab. Therefore, it is a humanized monoclonal antibody used against a tumor.
